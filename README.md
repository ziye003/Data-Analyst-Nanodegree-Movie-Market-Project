# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Movie-Market-Project

Project: Investigate a Dataset

# Project Overview

This is the third project of Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity. In this project, I'll analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make our analysis easier.

#### Why this project
In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process ( like EDA, Data Wrangling and Data Story Telling ).
I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.

#### What I learned
Some of the practices I learned from this project are:

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently 
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
